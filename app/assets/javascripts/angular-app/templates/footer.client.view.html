				<h3>TESTIMONIALS</h3>
				<p><span>“Thank you, Carolyne, for your amazing light, kind words, and a great (of many, I’m sure) “Prana Inspired” class at Endorphin at Park Hill. I loved the rhythm of your class. I left feeling incredibly energized and physically relaxed.”</span> Yoga instructor… Fania Kate</p>
				<p><span>“After trying a few yoga classes and not feeling enthused to return, my husband and I then decided to try Carolyne’s class. Carolyne has been the best yoga teacher we have experienced so far. My yoga ability improved so much while I was attending her classes and then she left to the US and I haven’t found any other teachers quite like her. She was always very attentive with the whole class and would always make sure we were all in the right position. She also has the experience to take a class of mixed ability and make sure everyone takes something from it. Come back to the UK!”</span>  Spa Director and mum Rachel Hale</p>
